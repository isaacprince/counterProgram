counterProgram — Code, Count, Learn

📘 counterProgram

A lightweight JavaScript counter program designed to apply and demonstrate foundational programming concepts in a practical way. This project showcases my early understanding of variables, arithmetic operators, user input, type conversion, and constants—turning theory into a simp

## ✨ What it does

- Increment, decrement, or reset a counter  
- Accept user input to set the counter to any number  
- Handle type conversion so numbers don’t break the app  
- Use constants and variables to keep logic organized

## 🚀 Features

- Increment and decrement the counter  
- Reset the counter to a default value  
- Accept user input to set or modify the counter  
- Dynamic type conversion to ensure valid calculations  
- Use of constants to maintain predictable logic

## 💡 Why it’s useful

It’s a tiny project but a **solid way to practice core JS concepts**:  
variables, arithmetic operators, user input, type conversion, and constants.  
Perfect for beginners who wanna see code actually **do stuff**.
